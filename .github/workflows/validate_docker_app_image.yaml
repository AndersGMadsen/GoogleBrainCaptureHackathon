# Workflow to validate that the docker image serving our app works as 
# expected BEFORE we push it to GCP. No need to push it to GCP and then 
# find out it doesn't work.

# NOTE: The linux/amd64 image is only built once in this workflow. 
# The image is built once, and the following steps use the internal 
# cache from the first Build and push step. The second Build and push 
# step only builds linux/arm64. (we want to test arm for macs :) )
